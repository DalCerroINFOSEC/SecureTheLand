## Hunting and Detection Tools and Resources
#### [Getting Started w/ ATT&CK | Operationalizing ATT&CK Based Hunting | Mitre.org/eBook](https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/mitre-getting-started-with-attack-october-2019.pdf)
###### Pulls together the content from MITRES four Getting Started blog posts on Threat Intelligence, Detection and Analytics, Adversary Emulation and Red Teaming, and Assessments and Engineering onto a single convenient package.

#### [Sigma | Signature/Detection Format | Github Page](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma)
###### Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows a standard way to write and share Detections and Queries. This resource can provide valuble detections that you can use to hunt and build detections from.
#### [Red Canary Atomics | ATT&CK Based Adversary Emulation Test Resource | Github Page](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)
###### Atomic Red Team allows every security team to test their controls by executing simple "atomic tests" that exercise the same techniques used by adversaries (all mapped to Mitre's ATT&CK).


## Lateral Movement
### Offensive
#### [Pass-the-Hash Attack | Pass the hash Walkthrough | Hackingarticles.in](https://www.hackingarticles.in/lateral-movement-pass-the-hash-attack/)

## Domain Domination
### Offensive
#### [Domain Controller Skeleton Key | DC Skeleton Key Attack Walkthrough/Backdoor Persistence in Domain | Hackingarticles.in](https://www.hackingarticles.in/domain-controller-backdoor-skeleton-key/)
###### The Skeleton Key is a particularly scary piece of malware targeted at Active Directory domains to make it alarmingly easy to hijack any account. This malware injects itself into LSASS and creates a master password that will work for any account in the domain. Existing passwords will also continue to work, so it is very difficult to know this attack.
#### [Shadow Move | ired.team](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/lateral-movement/shadowmove-lateral-movement-by-stealing-duplicating-existing-connected-sockets)
###### ShadowMove is a lateral movement technique that works by stealing (duplicating) an existing socket connected to a remote host, from a running process on a system an adversary has compromised.
